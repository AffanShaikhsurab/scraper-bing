## Installation

You can install the package using pip:

```

For development installation:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/affanshaikhsurab/scrape-bing.git
cd scrape_bing
pip install -e .
```

## Quick Start

```python
from scrape_bing import BingScraper

# Initialize the searcher
scraper= BingScraper(
    max_retries=3,
    delay_between_requests=1.0
)

# Perform a search
results = scraper.search("python programming", num_results=5)

# Process results
for result in results:
    print(f"\nTitle: {result.title}")
    print(f"URL: {result.url}")
    print(f"Description: {result.description}")
```

## Advanced Usage

### Custom Configuration

```python
# Configure with custom parameters
scraper = BingScraper(
    max_retries=5,                # Maximum retry attempts
    delay_between_requests=2.0    # Delay between requests in seconds
)
```

### Error Handling

```python
from scrape_bing import BingScraper

scraper = BingScraper()

try:
    results = scraper.search("python programming")
  
except ValueError as e:
    print(f"Invalid input: {e}")
  
except ConnectionError as e:
    print(f"Network error: {e}")
  
except RuntimeError as e:
    print(f"Parsing error: {e}")
```

### Search Result Structure

Each search result contains:

- `title`: The title of the search result
- `url`: The cleaned and validated URL
- `description`: The description snippet (if available)

```python
# Access result attributes
for result in results:
    print(result.title)       # Title of the page
    print(result.url)         # Clean URL
    print(result.description) # Description (may be None)
```
